Its a simple script that you can apply to any html page and center any text however you like.

1. Add "<script src="text-centerer.js"></script>" to your HTML page.

2. By clicking the mouse button on a element 
   you can switch the text to be centered between: "Left" , "Center", "Right"

2. After you are satisfied about your changes you can click "Enter" on your keyboard
   and it will download a copy of the html file with the commited changes.

3. After you download the file just delete the script links from the HTML and you are good to go.

4. MAKE SURE TO MOVE THE MOUSE AWAY FROM THE SCREEN BEFORE CLICKING "Enter", 
   BECAUSE IT WILL TAKE THE HOVER STYLE AS WELL.
